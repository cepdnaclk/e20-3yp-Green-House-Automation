Greenhouse farming plays a crucial role in modern agriculture, enabling year-round cultivation, improved crop yields, and better resource management. However, traditional greenhouse systems require constant human monitoring and intervention, leading to inefficiencies and labor-intensive processes. This project aims to develop an IoT-based Smart Greenhouse Automation System to optimize environmental conditions, enhance productivity, and minimize manual intervention.
